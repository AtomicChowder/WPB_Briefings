# WPB Daily Briefing — Claude Code Routine

## ⚠️ Execution Model — Read First

**Stream idle timeouts are the #1 failure mode.** They happen when Claude thinks for a long
time before calling a tool — the token stream goes idle and the API drops the connection.

**Rules to prevent timeouts:**
1. **Fire tool calls immediately** — never deliberate for more than 2–3 sentences before acting.
2. **Run all 10 search queries in one parallel batch** — do not search sequentially.
3. **Break briefing JSON writes into stepped Edit passes** — DO NOT write the full file at
   once. Pattern that worked on 2026-04-29:
   1. `printf` a 3-line skeleton with a `"PLACEHOLDER": true` field.
   2. `Read` once, then `Edit` to replace the placeholder with all metadata fields plus empty
      containers (`talking_points: []`, `articles_by_category: {}`, `chart_data: {...}`).
   3. `Edit` to add talking point #1 (replace the empty array).
   4. `Edit` to append talking points #2 and #3.
   5. `Edit` to seed `articles_by_category` with the AI & Technology array.
   6. `Edit` to append HSBC News articles.
   7. `Edit` to append Competitor Intelligence articles.
   8. `Edit` to append Private Banking + Regulatory + Operations.
   9. `Edit` to seed `chart_data.articles` with articles 1–8.
   10. `Edit` to append chart articles 9–15.
   11. Validate with `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open(...))"`.
   Repeat for the second user. Each Edit call carries < ~150 lines and emits quickly,
   so the API never sees an idle window long enough to time out.
4. **Reduce output volume** — never run `git diff`, `git log`, or `cat` of large files in the
   main context. Use `git status --short` only. Pipe `pip install` output to `tail -5`.
5. **Limit task scope per response** — execute one numbered step per response when possible.
   Each tool call should announce which step it is performing (e.g. "Step 7: add HSBC News").
6. **Delegate Notion + git deploy to subagents only when context is large** — subagents have
   independent streams that cannot idle-timeout the parent. For everyday runs, the stepped
   Edit approach in the main context is sufficient.
7. **If a subagent times out, re-launch it** — pass all computed data verbatim in the prompt
   so it is fully self-contained and can resume without re-doing research.

## Routine Prompt

> Read CLAUDE.md first — it contains all user profiles, scoring rubrics, the JSON schema,
> and context awareness instructions.

Run the daily WPB Market Intelligence Briefing for **Adam Chow** and **Surali Siriwardene**.

### For each user (run adam first, then surali):

**1. Check history**
Read `context/history.json`. Note the URLs and topics covered in the last 7 days so you
don't repeat them unless there's a material update.

**2. Search for news**
Use your web search tool to run each of the search queries listed in CLAUDE.md.

**Freshness rule:**
- If `covered_urls` is non-empty for this user → only collect articles published or updated
  **within the past 48 hours**. Discard anything older.
- If `covered_urls` is empty (first run) → relax to **7 days** to establish baseline coverage.

Aim for 12–20 articles per user after applying the freshness filter.

**3. Score and categorise**
For each article, assign:
- `hsbc_relevancy` (0–10) — per the rubric in CLAUDE.md
- `user_relevance` (0–10) — based on this specific user's role and interests
- `noise_level` (1–5) — breadth of coverage
- `category` — one of the 6 categories in CLAUDE.md

Discard articles with combined score (hsbc + relevance) below 6.
Keep a maximum of **3 articles per category**, sorted by combined score descending.

**4. Write 3 talking points**
Select the 3 most strategically significant stories for this user. Each talking point needs:
- `headline`: sharp, max 100 chars
- `why_it_matters`: one sentence on why this matters *specifically* to this user's role
- `bullets`: 3 concise bullet points. Wrap person names in `<strong>Name, Title</strong>` HTML tags.
- `source_links`: 1–3 supporting URLs as `{"url": "...", "title": "..."}` objects

Do not repeat talking points covered in the last 7 days unless there's a material update.

**5. Write `docs/{user_id}/briefing_data.json`**
Write the complete JSON file following the exact schema in CLAUDE.md.
Include `briefing_date` as a formatted string (e.g. "Saturday, 26 April 2026").
Include `generated_at` as UTC time.

**6. Render HTML**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -q
python src/render.py {user_id}
```
This reads the JSON and writes `docs/{user_id}/index.html`.

**7. Publish to Notion**
Using the Notion MCP connector, create a new page in the database
**"WPB Weekly Intelligence Briefings"** with:
- Title: `[{display_name}] WPB Briefing — {date}` (e.g. `[Adam] WPB Briefing — 26 Apr 2026`)
- A red callout with the user's name and title
- A divider
- Heading: "🎯 Key Talking Points" — then each talking point as Heading 3 + paragraph + bullet links
- A divider
- Heading: "📰 Intelligence Feed" — articles grouped by category as Heading 3 + bulleted links
  with scores: `[HSBC 7/10 · Rel 9/10] Article title` linked to article URL,
  followed by a grey paragraph for the summary

### After both users are done:

**8. Update history**
Merge today's covered URLs and talking point headlines into `context/history.json`.
Keep only the last 7 days of data per user.

**9. Commit, merge to main, and push**
```bash
git add docs/ context/history.json
git commit -m "briefing: YYYY-MM-DD daily intelligence update"

# If running on a feature branch, merge into main to trigger GitHub Pages
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
git push -u origin $BRANCH
if [ "$BRANCH" != "main" ]; then
  git fetch origin main
  git checkout main
  git merge --no-ff $BRANCH -m "briefing: YYYY-MM-DD daily intelligence update"
fi
git push origin main
```
This triggers GitHub Pages to publish the updated briefings automatically.
Pages deploys on every push to `main` that touches `docs/**` (see `.github/workflows/pages.yml`).

**10. Publish to GCS**
```bash
gsutil -m rsync -r -d docs/ gs://${GCS_BUCKET_NAME}/
```
This syncs the `docs/` folder to the GCS bucket for web hosting.
Set `Cache-Control` headers so browsers pick up updates immediately:
```bash
gsutil -m setmeta -h "Cache-Control:no-cache, max-age=0" \
  "gs://${GCS_BUCKET_NAME}/adam/index.html" \
  "gs://${GCS_BUCKET_NAME}/surali/index.html"
```
